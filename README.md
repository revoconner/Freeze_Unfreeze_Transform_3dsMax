# Freeze Unfreeze Transform [3dsMax]
A little MaxScript to freeze or unfreeze transform of the selected objects so you don't move it accidently. I mostly use it for cameras but you can use it for objects as well

# Instruction
You can open the file from script editor and then run, or you can drag and drop it into your scene. For easy to access, select the code inside the script and drag the selection onto your toolbar to create a handy button
